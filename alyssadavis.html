Angel / Erin Brady<br><br> Written by Cecilia Vidal <br> Sound by K. Mulhern <br>Costumes, set, production and meals by Sunday Collect<br> Table by Third Space <br><br> We performed our poetic dialogue/one act play 'I layed down by the river' at the  <a href="http://www.alyssadavis.gallery/exhibitions/" > Alyssa Davis Gallery</a> three times throughout the weekend of January 24th. Each performance was accompanied by a plant based meal on a table made for the occasion by Third Space. Attendees sat on a pillow sewn by Erin which mirrored the shape of the table. Each meal was thoughtfully made, corresponding with dinner, lunch, and breakfast.</p>
